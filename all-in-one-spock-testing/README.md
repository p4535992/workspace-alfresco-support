# Alfresco SDK AIO project with Spock tests
Contains the Spock tests demonstrated during the Alfresco brownbag October 15

Before doing any testing from your IDE do: 

  $mvn clean install -Prun-it

This will populate the integration-test-runner/target/repoWar directory with spring contexts from all modules (AMPs)
