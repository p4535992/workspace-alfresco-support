SHORT TERM (TODO):
* Review of the module.properties version replace. Can't it be just using resource filtering? 
(i.e. a more similar approach to the buildnumber or nosnapshot plugin)
* Review the amp-to-war profile. When ran from an AMP project abuses of
  the project.build.directory/project.build.finalName folder (both AMP and WAR content in there)
* Documentation
* Full release
    - Alfresco POMs
    - Developer & Parent POMs
    - Archetypes
    - Test test test

MID TERM
* Validate module.properties : make sure all properties are there and version is correct; if not, fix it
* Fail if module-context.xml is not present
* Implement <alfresco.version> and <alfresco.edition> configurations; based on that, the alfresco WAR dependency will be
included into the POM at runtime by the add-resources goal
* Test coverage (unit first, use mocking)
* Test AMP install with extensions from addons.alfresco.com
* Release alfresco-maven-plugin (on git - maven-alfresco-archetypes on Google Code)
* Finalize documentation and publish it (wiki.alfresco.com)
* Evaluate running JMeter Maven plugin in order to launch Alfresco test suites
