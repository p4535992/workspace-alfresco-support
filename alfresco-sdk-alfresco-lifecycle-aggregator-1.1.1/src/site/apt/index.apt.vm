Introduction

  The Maven Alfresco SDK\x99  - formerly {{{https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/alfresco-docs/maven-alfresco-lifecycle/latest/index.html} Maven Alfresco Lifecycle 3.9.1}} -
  provides a fully fledged Maven support for {{{http://www.alfresco.com}Alfresco ECM}} WAR and {{{https://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/AMP_Files}AMP}} project development.
  Being fully integrated with Maven it allows to both leverage the vast number of Maven plugins for your Alfresco project as well as integrated your
  project easily in Open Source and Enterprise development processes.

  The Maven Alfresco SDK\x99 is fully documented in the single components websites (links above) as well as updated on {{{https://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Maven_Alfresco_SDK}the Alfresco Wiki}}.
  
* Rationale

  The Alfresco Maven SDK introduces a new way of conceiving software development, deployment and release of Alfresco related projects and artifacts.
  In contrast to the manual (and error prone) deployment approach based on an installer / Alfresco WAR distribution(s) and the <infamous> <<<${extensionRoot}>>>,
  the Maven SDK provides a unified access to fine grained Artifacts (jar,war,pom files),] that can be easily integrated
  in your project by the means of Alfresco-specific Maven components and configurations. The main goal of this SDK is to 
  enable rapid development and prototyping of Alfresco projects, while enabling agile development practices (i.e. TDD, FDD)
  and fostering process reuse due to standardization
  
Maven Alfresco SDK\x99 components

  The Maven Alfresco SDK relies on a number of components:

  * {{{./poms/alfresco-sdk-parent/index.html}The SDK parent POM}} providing full Alfresco project lifecycle feature, to be added as a <<<<parent>>>> in your projects

  * Archetypes like the {{{./archetypes/alfresco-amp-archetype/index.html}AMP}} or {{{./archetypes/alfresco-allinone-archetype/index.html}All-in-One}} providing sample project to kickstart your Alfresco development and boost it with best practices
  
  * The {{{./plugins/alfresco-maven-plugin/index.html} Alfresco Maven Plugin}} to manage AMP packaging and dependencies
  
  * {{{https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/alfresco-docs/alfresco-platform-distribution/latest}Alfresco Platform Distribution POM}} can (optionally) be used to provide centralized <<<<dependencyManagement>>>> on a particular Alfresco version / edition (Community / Enterprise)  

  * The {{{https://artifacts.alfresco.com}Alfresco Artifacts Repository}} provides backing for this SDK. Check the {{{http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_Artifacts_Repository}Alfresco Wiki}} for Community / Enterprise access information. 

Pre-requisites

* System prerequisites

    No manual Alfresco download, application server or database is required. 
    See details in the {{{./prerequisites.html} SDK pre-requisites page}}.

* Alfresco Compatibility

  Maven Alfresco SDK\x99 ${project.version} is compatible (for now) with Alfresco Community (4.2b+) and Enterprise (4.1.2+).
  The majority of the features might still work when using lower Alfresco versions, but certain artifacts might not be 
  available in the {{{https://artifacts.alfresco.com}Alfresco Artifacts Repository}}. You can probably fix this with some
  Maven configuration, but use at your own risk.

Project History

  * Born in 2007 with the name of {{{http://forge.alfresco.com/gf/project/maven4alfresco/}maven4alfresco}}, later committed on google Code as {{{https://code.google.com/p/maven-alfresco-archetypes/}Maven Alfresco Archetypes}}
